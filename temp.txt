Dear Editor,

I am submitting our manuscript entitled "Personalized Short-term and Periodic Long-term Preferences Modeling with Contrastive Learning for Next POI Recommendation" for consideration of publication in IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems. This work is an extended version of our previous research presented at the DASFAA conference, with significant improvements and new contributions.

In this extended version, we refine the model by separately encoding short-term and long-term preferences, introducing a dedicated Long-Term Preference Encoder. We employ contrastive learning to effectively integrate these two types of preferences, improving recommendation accuracy. In contrast to our previous work, this paper includes a more comprehensive set of experiments, such as multi-scale ablation studies and visualization experiments, which provide deeper insights into the model's behavior and its effectiveness across various scenarios.

Our model, PSPLC, combines short-term spatial preferences with long-term periodic behaviors to offer personalized POI recommendations. Key innovations include the use of a Spatial Span Graph (S^2Graph) to model geographical preferences and the application of Mamba- and Discrete Wavelet Transform-based methods for capturing periodic patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing models.

We believe that our work provides valuable advancements in POI recommendation systems and will be of great interest to your journalâ€™s readership, particularly those working in computational social systems and recommender systems. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XHBACR/PSPLC.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration for publication in any other venue. All authors have approved the manuscript, and we have disclosed any potential conflicts of interest.

Thank you for considering our submission. We look forward to the opportunity to have our work published in IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems.

Sincerely,
